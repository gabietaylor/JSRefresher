# JSRefresher

#### JavaScript powers the dynamic behavior on most websites and it's a single threaded language.

# Console 

#### The console is used to record the output of JavaScript programs. The `console.log()` command is used to print, or log, text to the console.

# Data Types

#### Data types are the building blocks of all languages and essential pieces of any program.

* Strings — Any grouping of keyboard characters (letters, spaces, numbers, or symbols) surrounded by single quotes or double quotes.
* Numbers — Any number, including numbers with decimals.
* Either true or false, with no quotations.
* Null — Can only be null. It represents the absence of value.

# Math Operators

#### The value logs in the console.

1. Add `+`
2. Subtract `-`
3. Multiply `*`
4. Divide `/`

# Properties

#### When new data is introduced into a JavaScript program, the browser saves it as an instance of the data type. An instance is an individual case (or object) of a data type.

#### JavaScript will save a new piece of data as a string instance in the computer's memory. A number is stored as an instance of the number data type.

#### A string instance has additional information attached to it. Every string instance has a property called length that stores the number of characters in it. You can retrieve property information by appending the string with a period and the property name.

* The program will print the number of characters in the console.

# Built-In Methods

#### Built-in methods are called by appending an instance with a period, the name of the method, and opening (`(`) and closing (`)`) parentheses.

* `toUpperCase()` -  method returns a string in all capital letters
* `.startsWith()` - will return a boolean of `true` or `false` depending on value
